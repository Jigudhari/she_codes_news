        "content": "Douglas Justice is the associate director of the University of British Columbia’s botanical garden. He has agreed to lend his botanical expertise to us and share some of his favorite unusual plants.\r\n\r\nJustice’s love for plants is immediately evident in the way he speaks about them: “I’ve come across many unusual and compelling plants in my years. It’s difficult for me to choose favorites (the lists are always expanding). I can usually find something that’s interesting in nearly all plants—the way some flowers, like poppies, for example, are unpacked from their buds.\"\r\n\r\n\"How they go, miraculously, from crinkled and bent to satiny smooth. I also like repeating patterns in plants: how for every hebe species (shrubby Veronica) there is another species slightly different in leaf size, shape, color or leaf angle, and another intermediate between the two.”",

        "content": "When asked what unusual flora he would recommend for growing at home, Douglas suggests leaf succulents and peperomias. They are easily grown and excellent windowsill subjects. “Speaking of peperomias,” Justice goes on, “on a magnolia expedition in Colombia some years ago I encountered a tree branch festooned with epiphytic peperomias so small they could fit into a thimble.\r\n\r\n\"I have no idea what their names are. A day or so later in Jardin Botanico de Bogota Jose Celestino Mutis, we came across the exquisite blue-flowered bromeliad known as the 'sapphire tower' (Puya alpestris) and the Venezuelan conifer Retrophyllum rospigliossii, a tree with fern-like branchlets so regular and perfect they look like they were churned out in a 3D printer.” Reading about these botanical adventures gives me an urge for some plant expeditions.",

This plant is a knockout. Its purple-blue pendulous trumpets would be a welcome addition in any garden.”\r\n\r\nJustice then shares an adventure that suddenly makes me want to become the Short Round to his Indiana Jones. “[O]n a hillside in the Cocoro Valley (across from an expanse of Quindio wax palms) grew a huge red iochroma shrub (Iochroma gesnerioides), with ample clusters of hanging long-tubed flowers of a scarlet so intense it nearly burned the eyes.”",

        "content": "A Rising Tide of Female Talent Challenges Stereotypes and Drives Innovation\r\n\r\nIn a tech landscape traditionally dominated by men, women are making significant strides, challenging the notion that their presence in the industry is a statistical aberration. The narrative is shifting as more women embrace careers in technology, contributing their skills and perspectives to shape the future of the field.\r\n\r\nBreaking Stereotypes\r\n\r\nLong-standing stereotypes depicting the tech industry as a male-dominated domain have persisted for years. However, recent developments highlight a growing number of women breaking through barriers and making their mark. Industry leaders and advocates are emphasizing the importance of diversity in fostering innovation and problem-solving.\r\n\r\nLeadership and Innovation\r\n\r\nProminent figures like [Prominent Female Tech Leader], who serves as [Her Position] at [Her Company], are inspiring others with their leadership and groundbreaking contributions. These women are not merely statistical outliers but key players in steering technology towards new horizons.\r\n\r\nClosing the Gender Gap\r\n\r\nEfforts to close the gender gap in technology are gaining momentum, with various initiatives focused on encouraging girls and young women to pursue STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) education and careers. Schools, organizations, and companies are investing in programs that provide mentorship, scholarships, and networking opportunities to support women in the tech sector.\r\n\r\nChanging Narratives\r\n\r\nThe narrative is evolving from one of statistical anomaly to recognizing the inherent value that diverse perspectives bring to the tech industry. Companies are increasingly understanding that diverse teams lead to more creative problem-solving and enhanced innovation.\r\n\r\nGlobal Impact\r\n\r\nThis shift isn't confined to a specific region; it's a global movement. From Silicon Valley to emerging tech hubs worldwide, women are proving that their contributions are not just noteworthy but essential for the industry's progress.\r\n\r\nChallenges and Opportunities\r\n\r\nWhile progress is evident, challenges persist. Gender biases, workplace inequality, and a lack of representation at the executive level are hurdles that women in technology continue to face. However, these challenges also present opportunities for the industry to address and rectify systemic issues.\r\n\r\nLooking Ahead\r\n\r\nAs the tech landscape undergoes a transformation, women in technology are asserting their presence and influencing the industry's trajectory. The narrative is changing from statistical aberration to recognizing women as integral contributors to the technological advancements that shape our future.\r\n\r\nIn the coming years, the hope is that the headlines will shift focus from the gender of tech professionals to the groundbreaking innovations and transformative changes they bring to the world. Women in technology are not anomalies—they are pioneers, trailblazers, and indispensable contributors to the ever-evolving realm of technology.",
